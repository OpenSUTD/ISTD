# SUTD Compute JupyterHub

ISTD Student Board is working with Temasek Labs to host a small GPU cluster of 10+ GPUs. We have run some smaller scale proof of concepts previously but are now working to set up a "proper" cluster that will serve ISTD students.

If you're interested to participate, please contact `timothy_liu[at]mymail.sutd.edu.sg`.
