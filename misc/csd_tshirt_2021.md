# CSD T-shirt Design Contest 2021

In light of the degree name change from _ISTD (Information Systems Technology and Design)_ to **CSD (Computer Science and Design)**, we are going to design a new CSD T-shirt!

We encourage you to submit your design to us, and we will get everyone to vote for their favorite one. The winning T-shirt will be produced and distributed to every CSD student/staff, and the winner will walk away with a cash prize and hopefully a great sense of accomplishment!

PS: This is an official CSD T-shirt (Annual) Design Contest sponsored by the [ISTD Pillar](https://istd.sutd.edu.sg/) and proudly organized by [ISTD Student Board](https://istd.opensutd.org/)!

    -   Prizes for the runner-ups will be determined by the quality of the submissions and the number of votes they received.

## Design Guidelines

<!-- -   Please only use colors listed under the 'COTTON' tab on [this page](https://theteeinkers.com/colorSize). -->

-   Try to use as few colors as possible, preferably less than 5, as more colors may result in higher printing costs.
-   If your design incorporates SUTD's logo or any of SUTD's official branding assets, please do not distort its original appearance and be aware that the final winning T-shirt design is subject to the school/pillar's approval. We will work with the winner to make minor adjustments if needed at the pre-production stage. You may download the relevant SUTD logos [[here]](resources/SUTD_LOGOs.zip).
-   You may consider designing an unofficial logo for CSD. Previously, we had [[this]](https://istd.opensutd.org/assets/img/istd-logo.png) unofficial ISTD logo also designed by a student.
-   Click [[here]](resources/istd_tshirt.pdf) to view the existing ISTD T-shirt design for reference.
-   You could start your design on any T-shirt design template available online. We will post one here if we find a good one.

## Submission Guidelines

-   You may submit multiple design entries for voting (but not too many!).
-   Your submission should contain all design source files (e.g. `.ai`/`.psd`) and at least two `jpeg`/`png` images (for each entry) showing the front and back of the T-shirt.
-   Zip everything together and submit your design via this [[submission form]](https://forms.gle/7Qo49Ymy4pq4zFh16).
