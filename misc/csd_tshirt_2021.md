# CSD T-shirt Design Contest 2021

In light of the degree name change from _ISTD (Information Systems Technology and Design)_ to **CSD (Computer Science and Design)**, we are going to design a new CSD T-shirt!

We encourage you to submit your design to us, and we will get everyone to vote for their favorite one. The winning T-shirt will be produced and distributed to every CSD student/staff, and the winner will walk away with a cash prize and hopefully a great sense of accomplishment!

PS: This is an official CSD T-shirt (Annual) Design Contest sponsored by the [ISTD Pillar](https://istd.sutd.edu.sg/) and proudly organized by [ISTD Student Board](https://istd.opensutd.org/)!

    -   Prizes for the runner-ups will be determined by the quality of the submissions and the number of votes they received.
